<h2><span>My First Startup Experience : There's A Hidden Dark Side To Being An Entrepreneur</span></h2>

I know enough people who have dreamt of starting a company, but they never took the first step. You need courage, and the mindset of an entrepreneur, to test the waters in the ocean of startups.

<h4><span>Entrepreneurship is not for you if one of the following is true for you.</span></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Career growth means a greater-than-10% salary hike and a more impressive job title.</li>
	<li>Life settlement means owning a house, having a beautiful wife and two smart kids.</li>
	<li>Startups are a hot topic during lunch and weekend parties only, but no one does anything to make them a reality.</li>
	<li>You know how to make quick bucks by fooling people, and you think the same tactic can be applied to a startup.</li>
	<li>The value (financial) of one month of your life is not more than one month of your salary, in your opinion.</li>
	<li>You seek an expert’s help to move forward in an unfamiliar work situation, and are afraid of challenges.</li>
	<li>You don’t try new things because statistics say that the probability of failure is 90%.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span>Entrepreneurship is for brave hearts</span></h4>

<ul>
	<li>You have to be mentally strong</li>
	<li>You won’t raise money overnight</li>
	<li>Your co-founders may leave you mid-way</li>
	<li>Your potential investors may ditch you after promising funding.</li>
	<li>Going near cashless becomes routine (be prepared for inconsistent income)</li>
</ul>

You know it’s not an easy journey. You have to bear a lot of pain. It is scary to leave your job and follow your passion, Frustration, Insecurity, Addiction of work, Family relationships suffer, No social life etc... We hear success stories of startups, but no one tells us how many failures are buried under that success.
