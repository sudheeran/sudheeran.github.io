<h2><span>Artificial intelligence is changing SEO faster than you think : post by John Rampton</span></h2>

By now everyone has heard of Google’s RankBrain, the new artificial intelligence machine learning algorithm that is supposed to be the latest and greatest from Mountain View, Calif.

<h4><span>What is RankBrain?</span></h4>

RankBrain is Google’s name for a machine-learning artificial intelligence system that’s used to help process its search results.


<h4><span>So RankBrain is the new way Google ranks search results?</span></h4>

No. RankBrain is part of Google’s overall search “algorithm,” a computer program that’s used to sort through the billions of pages it knows about and find the ones deemed most relevant for particular queries.

<h4><span>So what is artificial intelligence?</span></h4>

There are generally three different classifications of artificial intelligence:

<ul>
	<li>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): This is like AI for one particular thing (e.g. beating the world champion in chess).</li>
	<li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): This is when the AI can perform all things. Once an AI can perform like a human, we consider it AGI.</li>
	<li>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): AI on a much higher level for all things (e.g. beyond the capabilities of a single human).</li>
</ul>

When we talk about the context of Google’s RankBrain, and the machine learning algorithms that are currently running on Google, we are talking about Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI).

<h4><span>The future of SEO and artificial intelligence</span></h4>

RankBrain and other forms of artificial intelligence will at some point surpass the human brain. And at this point, nobody knows where this technology will lead us.

Some things are certain, though:

<ul>
	<li>Each competitive keyword environment will need to be examined on its own</li>
	<li>Most sites will need to stay niche to avoid misclassification</li>
	<li>Each site should mimic the structure and composition of their respective top sites in that niche.</li>
</ul>

In some ways, the deep learning methodology makes things simpler for SEOs. Knowing that RankBrain and similar technologies are almost on par with a human, the rule of law is clear: There are no more loopholes.

In other ways, things are a bit harder. The field of SEO will continue to become extremely technical. Analytics and big data are the order of the day, and any SEO that isn’t familiar with these approaches has a lot of catching up to do. Those of you who have these skills can look forward to a big payday.
