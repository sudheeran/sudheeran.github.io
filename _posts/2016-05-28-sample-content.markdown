In his book The <code> Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs </code>, Carmine Gallo lays out 18 steps you can follow to give talks like the founder of Apple:


<h4>1.Plan in analog</h4>

Don't get stuck in PowerPoint from the start. Play with ideas loosely on whiteboards or index cards.

<h4>2.Answer the one question that matters most</h4>

And that question is, "Why should I care?"

<h4>3.Develop a messianic sense of purpose</h4>

Where is your passion for this subject coming from? Convey that.

<h4>4.Create Twitter-like headlines</h4>

Be to the point in your copy. People don't want to read, they want to hear a story.

<h4>5.Draw a road map</h4>

Use a three-act structure so your audience feels the presentation is organized, with a beginning, middle, and end.

<h4>6.Introduce the antagonist</h4>

What's the problem that needs to be solved or the enemy to be overcome?

<h4>7.Reveal the conquering hero</h4>

What's the solution to the problem? What's the new angle or development that will lead to victory?

<h4>8.Channel their inner Zen</h4>

Keep everything simple, to the point, and minimalist.

<h4>9.Dress up your numbers</h4>

Present stats in a context that is relevant to your audience.

<h4>10.Use 'amazingly zippy' words</h4>

Review your copy closely, and edit, edit, edit.

<h4>11.Share the stage</h4>

It's not a one-man show. Rotate in other presenters if possible.

<h4>12.Stage your presentation with props</h4>

Add life and break up stretches of talk by giving demos.

<h4>13.Reveal a Holy Shit moment</h4>

There's always a surprise at the end â€” a scripted one.

<h4>14.Master stage presence</h4>

Manage your body language and delivery. Match them to what your presentation requires.

<h4>15.Make it look effortless</h4>

Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.

<h4>16.Wear the appropriate costume</h4>

Dress like the leader you want to become.

<h4>17.Toss the script</h4>

Once you've rehearsed it all, make it relaxed and natural.

<h4>18.Have fun</h4>

Even if things go sideways, roll with it.
