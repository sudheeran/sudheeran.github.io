<h2><span>How Airbnb designs for trust by Joe Gebbia</span></h2>

Joe Gebbia, the co-founder of Airbnb, bet his whole company on the belief that people can trust each other enough to stay in one another's homes. How did he overcome the stranger-danger bias? Through good design. Now, 123 million hosted nights (and counting) later, Gebbia sets out his dream for a culture of sharing in which design helps foster community and connection instead of isolation and separation.

A great brand is not about logos, colors and fonts. A great brand is about the way you make people FEEL.
