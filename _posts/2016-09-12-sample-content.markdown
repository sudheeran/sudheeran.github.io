<h2>BigData made easy by using Google BigQuery!</h2>

What is Google BigQuery?

Google BigQuery is a cloud-based big data analytics web service for processing very large read-only data sets.

Storing and querying massive datasets can be time consuming and expensive without the right hardware and infrastructure. Google BigQuery is an enterprise data warehouse that solves this problem by enabling super-fast SQL queries using the processing power of Google's infrastructure. Simply move your data into BigQuery and let us handle the hard work. You can control access to both the project and your data based on your business needs, such as giving others the ability to view or query your data.

BigQuery was designed for analyzing data on the order of billions of rows, using a SQL-like syntax. It runs on the Google Cloud Storage infrastructure and can be accessed with a REST-oriented application program interface (API).

You can access BigQuery by using a web UI or a command-line tool, or by making calls to the BigQuery REST API using a variety of client libraries such as Java, .NET or Python. There are also a variety of third-party tools that you can use to interact with BigQuery, such as visualizing the data or loading the data.
