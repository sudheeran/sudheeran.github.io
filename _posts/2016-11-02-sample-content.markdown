<h2>Google’s AMP Is Speeding Up the Web By Changing How It Works!</h2>


AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, a Google-backed project designed as an open standard for any publisher to have pages load quickly on mobile devices.

AMP HTML is a way to build web pages for static content that render with reliable, fast performance. It is our attempt at fixing what many perceive as painfully slow page load times – especially when reading content on the mobile web.

On Feb. 24, 2016, Google officially integrated AMP listings into its mobile search results. Pages making use of AMP coding appear within special places in the search results and/or with a special “AMP” designation.


<strong>AMP in action consists of three different parts:</strong>

<ul>
	<li><strong>AMP HTML :</strong> is HTML with some restrictions for reliable performance and some extensions for building rich content beyond basic HTML.</li>
	<li><strong>AMP JS :</strong> The AMP JS library ensures the fast rendering of AMP HTML pages.</li>
	<li><strong>Google AMP Cache :</strong> Google AMP Cache can be used to serve cached AMP HTML pages.</li>
</ul>
