<h2>TAM SAM SOM - What it means and why it matters?</h2>

Having viewed several business plans over the years, a common (and very important) item missing from most plans is a breakdown of the company’s TAM, SAM, and SOM in the marketing section of their plan.

Wondering what these acronyms mean? You’re not alone—many entrepreneurs are not familiar with these terms.

<strong>Here’s a quick explanation of what they mean, followed by an example:</strong>

<ul>
	<li><strong>TAM : </strong>Your Total Available or Addressable Market (everyone you wish to reach with your product) :  <a href="https://www.divestopedia.com/definition/4974/total-addressable-market-tam" target="_blank" style="font-size:14px;">Know More</a></li>
	<li><strong>SAM : </strong>Your Segmented Addressable Market or Served Available Market (the portion of TAM you will target)</li>
	<li><strong>SOM : </strong>Your Share of the Market (the subset of your SAM that you will realistically reach – particularly in the first few years of your business)</li>
</ul>

Identifying your TAM, SAM, and SOM requires some market research (levels of research vary depending on your product and market potential), but once you gather the research you’ll have a better of idea of the percentages that coincide with each area.
